Documentation for IAST Package
================================

This Python package takes pure component gas adsorption isotherms in a nanoporous material and predicts mixture isotherms. Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST) is the framework used to predict the mixture adsorption isotherm from the pure component adsorption isotherms.

This code has three options to apply IAST to the pure component adsorption isotherms:

1. Fit a Langmuir isotherm model
2. Fit a quadratic isotherm model
3. Use linear interpolation (numerical quadrature for spreading pressures)

============
Installation
============

Clone the repository on `Github <https://github.com/CorySimon/IAST>`_. `cd` into the folder with the source code, `/src`, and run the setup script:

.. code-block:: python
   
   python setup.py

===
Use
===

As an example for use, see the `/test` directory. We test the IAST code with a binary mixture of Xe and Kr in IRMOF-1.

Simulated pure component adsorption isotherms at 298 K (from single componenent grand-canonical Monte Carlo) are present in:

- `IRMOF-1_clean_Xe_isotherm_298K.csv`
- `IRMOF-1_clean_Kr_isotherm_298K.csv`

We simulated binary mixture isotherms of Xe/Kr in IRMOF-1 at 1 bar total pressure and at different mixture conditions using dual-component grand-canonical Monte Carlo. This data is present in `mixture_Xe_Kr_IRMOF-1_clean_298K.csv`. We use IAST to reproduce this result.

First, import the `IAST` package:

.. code-block:: python

   import IAST

-----------------------------------
Import the pure component isotherms
-----------------------------------

Use the `Pandas` package to load the pure component adsorption isotherms as DataFrames:

.. code-block:: python
    
    import pandas as pd
    df_Xe = pd.read_csv("IRMOF-1_clean_Xe_isotherm_298K.csv", skiprows=1)
    df_Kr = pd.read_csv("IRMOF-1_clean_Kr_isotherm_298K.csv", skiprows=1)

The units for pressure and loading in both DataFrames must be consistent; loading of gas must be in a molar quantity for IAST to apply (e.g. mmol/g or mmol/cm3). The `IAST` package will then work with these units throughout. 

--------------------------
Construct isotherm objects
--------------------------

We separate the process of characterizing the pure component adsorption isotherms from performing IAST. Construct the models by passing the DataFrame with the pure component adsorption isotherm and the names of the columns that correspond to the loading and pressure.

* Langmuir isotherm model

.. code-block:: python

    xe_isotherm = IAST.LangmuirIsotherm(df_Xe, 
                                        loading_key="Loading(mol/m3)", 
                                        pressure_key="Pressure(bar)")
    kr_isotherm = IAST.LangmuirIsotherm(df_Kr, 
                                        loading_key="Loading(mol/m3)", 
                                        pressure_key="Pressure(bar)")

* Quadratic isotherm model

.. code-block:: python

    xe_isotherm = IAST.QuadraticIsotherm(df_Xe, 
                                         loading_key="Loading(mol/m3)", 
                                         pressure_key="Pressure(bar)")
    kr_isotherm = IAST.QuadraticIsotherm(df_Kr, 
                                         loading_key="Loading(mol/m3)", 
                                         pressure_key="Pressure(bar)")

* Linear interpolation model

The linear interpolation model has an additional, optional argument `fill_value` that tells us what loading to assume when we attempt to extrapolate beyond the data point with the highest pressure. In this example, we assume that the loading at the highest pressure point is equal to the saturation loading. By default, `fill_value=None` and an error is thrown when the IAST code tries to extrapolate loading beyond the highest pressure point in the pure component adsorption isotherm.

.. code-block:: python

    xe_isotherm = IAST.InterpolatorIsotherm(df_Xe, 
                                            loading_key="Loading(mol/m3)", 
                                            pressure_key="Pressure(bar)", 
                                            fill_value=df_Xe["Loading(mol/m3)"].max())
    kr_isotherm = IAST.InterpolatorIsotherm(df_Kr, 
                                            loading_key="Loading(mol/m3)", 
                                            pressure_key="Pressure(bar)", 
                                            fill_value=df_Kr["Loading(mol/m3)"].max())

Once an isotherm model is constructed, we can view the fit of the isotherm model to the data by:

.. code-block:: python

   IAST.plot_isotherm(xe_isotherm)
   
The plot can be rendered on the log-scale by passing options `xlogscale=True` and/or `ylogscale=False`.

Using the adsorption isotherm objects, we can calculate the predicted loading at a new pressure, for example 1.0, by:

.. code-block:: python

   xe_isotherm.loading(1.0)
   
or the spreading pressure via:

.. code-block:: python

   xe_isotherm.spreading_pressure(1.0)

-----------------------
Peform IAST calculation
-----------------------

Given the pure component isotherm models, we now illustrate how to use IAST to predict loading when the material is in equilibrium with a mixture of the said gases.

As an example, given the pure component adsorption isotherm objects `xe_isotherm` and `kr_isotherm` above, we seek the loading [at the same temperature as the pure component isotherms] at a 20/80 mol % Xe/Kr mixture at a pressure of 1.0. To do this, we call:

.. code-block:: python
    
    p = [.2, .8]  # list/array of partial pressures
    q = IAST.IAST(p, [xe_isotherm, kr_isotherm], verboseflag=True)

which will return `q`, an array of component loadings at these mixture conditions predicted by IAST. Entry 0 will correspond to Xe; entry 1 will correspond to Kr.

------------------------
Reverse IAST calculation
------------------------

In reverse IAST, we specify the mole fractions of gas in the *adsorbed* phase and the total bulk gas pressure, then calculate the bulk gas composition that yields these adsorbed mole fractions. This is useful e.g. in catalysis, where one seeks to control the composition of gas adsorbed in the material.

As an example,  given the pure component adsorption isotherm objects `xe_isotherm` and `kr_isotherm` above, we seek the bulk gas composition [at the same temperature as the pure component isotherms] that will yield a 20/80 mol % Xe/Kr mixture in the *adsorbed phase* at a total bulk gas pressure of 1.0. To do this, we call:

.. code-block:: python
    
    P_total = 1.0
    z = [.2, .8]  # list/array of 
    y, q = IAST.reverse_IAST(z, P_total, [xe_isotherm, kr_isotherm])

which will return `y`, the desired bulk gas phase mole fractions, and `q`, an array of component loadings at these mixture conditions predicted by IAST. Entry 0 will correspond to Xe; entry 1 will correspond to Kr.

Theory

Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory was developed by Myers and Prausnitz:

We follow the method outlined in the reference:

Tarafder, A. and Mazzotti, M. A method for deriving explicit binary isotherms obeying ideal adsorbed solution theory. Chem. Eng. Technol. 2012, 35, No. 1, 102-108.

=====
Tests
=====

This code was tested using pure component Xe and Kr adsorption isotherms in IRMOF-1 to predict the uptake of Xe and Kr at 1 bar in a variety of Xe mole fractions. The test is displayed in `this IPython notebook <https://github.com/CorySimon/IAST/blob/master/test/Test.ipynb>`_, and the files are in the `/test` directory.

TL;DR The following plot shows the simulated Xe/Kr adsorption (points) using binary grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulations against the IAST prediction from pure-component adsorption isotherms (solid lines).
