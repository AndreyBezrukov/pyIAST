# Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory

This Python package takes pure component gas adsorption isotherms in a nanoporous material and predicts a mixture isotherm, how much of each gas will adsorb when the material is in equilibrium with a multi-component mixture. Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST) is the framework used to predict the mixture adsorption isotherm from the pure component adsorption isotherms.
