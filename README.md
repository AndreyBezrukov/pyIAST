# pyIAST: Python package for Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory

This Python package takes pure component gas adsorption isotherms in a nanoporous material and predicts mixture isotherms. Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST) is the framework used to predict the mixture adsorption isotherm from the pure component adsorption isotherms.
